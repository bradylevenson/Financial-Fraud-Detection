Feedback for Report
Feedback 1: Thorough and Well-Structured Methodology
Your paper excels in presenting a clear and comprehensive breakdown of the model development life cycle. Each step, from problem identification to deployment, is well-explained and tied to its practical implications. Actions like dimensionality reduction and hyperparameter tuning are described in detail, showcasing a strong grasp of advanced techniques. The logical flow and organization make your work easy to follow, and your attention to detail is commendable. I also really appreciate all the images you included in the report. They make it easily digestible, give readers a break for their eyes, and provide more context into what you are doing.
Feedback 2: Innovative and Domain-Specific Feature Engineering
The feature engineering section demonstrates creativity and domain expertise. Features like Deviation_From_Mean_Account and Hour_Group_AccountID are insightful constructs that effectively address patterns in fraudulent behavior. The thoughtful application of one-hot encoding and embeddings balances interpretability with efficiency, highlighting your ability to tailor techniques to the problem at hand. These innovations significantly enhance the quality of your analysis.
Feedback 3: Opportunities for Expanded Model Comparisons and Clarity
While the paper is thorough, incorporating additional evaluation metrics—such as precision, recall, or F1-score—could strengthen your model comparison and better address the critical nature of false negatives in fraud detection. A deeper exploration of how different algorithms (e.g., K-Means, LOF, and DBSCAN) perform across these metrics would provide stronger support for your final model choice. Additionally, simplifying the explanation of feature selection for accessibility and providing more context on why silhouette scores were prioritized would enhance readability. Including clearer deployment details, such as how monitoring thresholds will function in practice, would further improve the real-world applicability of your report.

Feedback for GitHub Repository
Feedback 1: Overall GitHub Structure
Your repository is well-organized, and I appreciate the clear folder structure you've chosen: data, reports, notebook, and model. This makes it easy to navigate the different components of the project. The organization is intuitive and allows for a smooth exploration of the project's various stages.
Feedback 2: Data Folder
The data folder contains a series of week-based zip files, which is great for organizing your data by time. However, it would be helpful to include a brief explanation in README.md or a separate file detailing what each dataset represents and its purpose. For example, clarifying the differences between Train, Test, and Validation data across the weeks would add transparency for anyone exploring your repository. Additionally, I noticed a financial_anomaly_data2.csv file that doesn’t seem to fit with the rest of the week-based datasets. Providing context for this file, either in the folder or through a comment, would be beneficial for users unfamiliar with its role in the project.
Feedback 3: Reports and Model Folders
The weekly reports are a great addition as they document the project's progression. Since each report is already clearly titled by week, this is well-organized. To further enhance the usability of the reports folder, you could consider adding a brief overview of the goals and outcomes for each week in the README.md file within the folder. This would give potential users or collaborators a quick understanding of your project's timeline and the decisions made throughout the course of the project. It’s also excellent that you’ve included both Jupyter notebooks and PDFs for each week, which helps provide a well-rounded view of your work. Having a final model in the model folder is a nice touch to demonstrate the culmination of your efforts.

Feedback for Code
Feedback 1: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
The code does a great job in demonstrating a comprehensive approach to data preprocessing and feature engineering. The handling of missing values, the use of one-hot encoding, and the log transformation of the 'Amount' variable are all well-thought-out steps that contribute to a robust data preparation process. Additionally, the creation of new features like 'Hour_Group' and 'Deviation_From_Mean' reflects a strong understanding of how to transform raw data into features that enhance model performance. To improve this section further, it would be helpful to include comments explaining the rationale behind choosing these specific transformations and feature engineering steps. For example, explaining why the log transformation of 'Amount' is appropriate for the dataset could help others better understand the thought process behind these decisions and improve the reproducibility of your work.
Feedback 2: Model Selection and Bias-Variance Tradeoff
The code demonstrates a solid understanding of the bias-variance tradeoff by evaluating and comparing three different model types—K-Means, LOF, and DBSCAN. This range of models shows careful consideration of different algorithmic approaches, each with unique bias-variance characteristics. By testing multiple models, the code explores how each one handles the tradeoff between model complexity and generalization performance. To enhance this part of the project, you could consider providing more context for your hyperparameter choices. For example, explaining why you chose values for hyperparameters in the K-Means models (such as the number of clusters or initialization method) would provide additional clarity on your model selection process. This additional commentary would improve the transparency of your decision-making process and offer deeper insight into the model comparison.
Feedback 3: Dimensionality Reduction and Code Modularity
The use of dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and embedding is effectively implemented to reduce categorical feature dimensionality while maintaining important information. This approach addresses potential issues with high-dimensional data, ensuring that the modeling process remains computationally efficient without sacrificing important feature relationships. However, there is room for improvement in code modularity. Several functions, such as create_hour_group_columns and calculate_stats, are repeated across different datasets (training, validation, and test). Combining these into a single reusable function would help to eliminate redundancy and improve the organization of the code. This would also enhance the maintainability and scalability of the project. For example, you could create a more generalized function that accepts dataset-specific arguments (e.g., train, validation, test) and performs the same operations. This would reduce the chances of errors and make the code more efficient.

Feedback for Code Output
Feeback 1:  Feature Engineering and Embedding Layers
The code does an excellent job of generating new features from the initial dataset, showcasing a strong understanding of feature engineering. The output demonstrates the creation of combinations of existing features and the use of one-hot encoding to transform categorical variables. Additionally, the use of embedding layers to represent categorical variables as dense vectors is a thoughtful approach that can improve model performance by capturing complex relationships between categories. This indicates that the model can better capture underlying patterns and enhance predictive accuracy. To further improve this section, consider providing comments in the code that explain the reasoning behind choosing specific features for transformation and encoding. This will help users understand the decisions made during feature engineering and how they contribute to the model's overall performance.
Feedback 2: Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning
The code's approach to systematically evaluating multiple model variations with different hyperparameters, including K-Means, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and DBSCAN, is a thorough and well-rounded approach. This experimentation helps identify the best-performing model for the task at hand. The exploration of different models allows for a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses and ensures that the most suitable model is selected. However, there are some warnings related to the structure of inputs in the embedding model. These warnings should be addressed as they may indicate issues that could affect the accuracy and functionality of the model. I recommend reviewing the model architecture and input data format to resolve these warnings, ensuring that the model is performing optimally.
Feedback 3: Cluster Quality Evaluation and Bias Analysis
The use of the Dunn Index to evaluate cluster quality is a solid approach, but the current implementation might benefit from a more robust method. While using cdist to calculate distances is a good start, the code currently uses the maximum inter-cluster distance, which may not fully capture the true separation between clusters. A more accurate approach would be to use the minimum inter-cluster distance, which provides a clearer distinction between well-separated clusters. Additionally, the current bias analysis focuses on feature distributions across clusters but does not address potential biases that may stem from the choice of algorithms or hyperparameters. Expanding the bias analysis to evaluate the fairness and impact of the selected models would be valuable. This could include analyzing performance disparities across different groups or incorporating fairness-aware algorithms into the model. This expanded analysis would offer a more comprehensive view of model fairness and ensure that the model works equitably across various demographics.
